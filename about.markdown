# About Me

        <p>Hi there! I am a fourth year mechanical engineering PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, using computer modeling and process monitoring approaches to study laser-based additive manufacturing. I have a broad skillset that spans a wide range of engineering disciplines in both hardware and software.</p>In my spare time, I enjoy building hardware and software projects, running, playing guitar and piano, traveling, and just being outside. I'll also talk ad nauseam about any of the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li>My favorite running routes</li>
            <li>The history of spaceflight</li>
            <li>University of Oregon or Oregon State University athletics</li>
            <li>90s and 2000s Alt Rock</li>
            <li>The best Trader Joes snacks</li>
        </ul>
